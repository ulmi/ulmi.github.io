Not for lack of ideas, but for lack of focus. Still, today will be a quick post, more in the &lt;strong>TIL&lt;/strong> (Today I Learned) spirit, and maybe mostly for future reference so I don’t have to get lost again in searches and manuals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Documenting a database is a tricky business. It’s not enough to design and structure the DB — we also have to ensure that the whole structure makes sense to whoever will evaluate whether the “design” meets the requirements before it moves to production. In fact, it becomes a very useful tool during &lt;em>staging&lt;/em>, when the DB is ready for production, and even afterwards. In other words: documentation is never a waste.&lt;/p></description><media:content xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://ulmi.github.io/posts/1760962816589-dbdocumenting/featured.png"/></item></channel></rss>
