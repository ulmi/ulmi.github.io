It was sad but a relief form a chaotic and neurotic 2024, but that\u0026rsquo;s all other story to share about that experience.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t start anything new in the meantime, apart from some new side projects, small and to get the mind busy and uncomfortable as one should - like this was and I failed to maintain it - where one of those projects surely does make me more uncomfortable than I should be, do to it\u0026rsquo;s scale, but LFG!\nBut again, that\u0026rsquo;s for a whole new batch of posts, cause I need something to write about, and also finish the DeNorm series.\nSo this brings me to today\u0026rsquo;s post!!\nThe framework 13 # So by selling my part in company, I needed to buy a new laptop, cause my old Dell was a company propriety. So I thought it was the right time to buy one, a new one I mean.\nThe last new laptop I bought, was my MacBook Pro in 2008, which had one of those faulty Nvidia GPUs, which I didn\u0026rsquo;t know until it died, and to my surprise it died 3 months after the extended warranty expired, and for the logic board repair, they quoted me at the time over 600€ in 2013, that I just refused to pay.\nAfter this I went full-on to linux on refurbished laptops, just having two since then via the company.\nAnd along comes Framework with their products and approach, and it was right at my alley. \u0026ldquo;Simple\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;yours\u0026rdquo; and repairable.\nSo it seemed to be the right time for me to go with the framework 13 laptop version, and went almost fully DIY. Well I cheated a bit, cause I bought the chassis kit, that it comes almost assembled and with most of the parts, missing \u0026lsquo;just\u0026rsquo; the mainboard, Wi-Fi adapter, RAM, and storage. Almost like buying a pre-assembled IKEA where you just tighten the loose screws.\nFor the mainboard I went with the AMD Ryzen 5 7640U, cause the the Ryzen AI 5 340 doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be what it should, performance-wise and the AMD Ryzen 7 7840U was not available for shipping. I would prefer the AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370, but that\u0026rsquo;s on whole new ballpark when it comes to price. Added to the mainboard I went with 64 Gb of RAM, and a 2Tb NVMe.\nWhere are some pictures of the assembly.\nAdding the Wifi adapter was the only thing that actually made me sweat a bit.\nBut what made me really sweat was the first boot. Why? Because it just showed a black screen. It seemed on, but nothing happened! So I plugged it into the power socket and forced a reset, and still a black screen but with a little more brightness\u0026hellip;by now the sweat just poured\u0026hellip;\nAfter a few seconds that felt like minutes, the BIOS posted.\nThe distro and the experience # With that tragedy averted, I installed Fedora 42 Kinoite, which went flawlessly, everything just worked as it should, even sleep mode (Linux folks will understand) on the 1st boot it even asked me to configure the fingerprint sensor that works as expected. Although I disable it (but just in the CLI), cause the sudo commands would default to the fingerprint instead of the password.\nAfter some fussing about, I installed some apps, like VSCodium, KeePassXC, Bottles, etc\u0026hellip;I rebooted and went to the BIOS to explore.\nOn the BIOS, I expected to have more control over it, like giving the APU more memory - it seems to be capped at the 4Gb or it allocates that as a baseline and it increases on demand, it\u0026rsquo;s not clear - hence the 64 RAM install. But aside from that, a really simple and straightforward BIOS but an older version. So after checking that there\u0026rsquo;s an update of the BIOS. And, ohhh boy, it baffles me how LVFS isn\u0026rsquo;t a mainstream thing - or it is and I\u0026rsquo;ve been living under a rock? Just copy paste 3 commands to the terminal, wait for a while\u0026hellip;and BOOM, it\u0026rsquo;s done, BIOS updated, still no update on the RAM to GPU, but LMStudio shows some promising VRAM, need to test it though.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been using the laptop for almost a month now, and it\u0026rsquo;s lovely, really pleased with the overall experience, it really has a good balance being performant enough without compromise\u0026hellip; well, almost, because there\u0026rsquo;s a not-so-great part, more below. I really love the screen and I really like the keyboard.\nThe Good, the bad and the wonderful # I\u0026rsquo;m not a reviewer, nor is this a review for the framework 13 laptop, just my actual experience with it.\nAnd I just love it, it\u0026rsquo;s small, robust and it just works, as it should with no need for any extra meddling, apart from the assembly. And it\u0026rsquo;s just awesome how it doesn\u0026rsquo;t look like a computer partially assembled at home.\nAnd that is one of the things that\u0026rsquo;s it\u0026rsquo;s very remarkable to me, it really is. It\u0026rsquo;s a laptop made with love, care, ingenuity with reparability in mind without lacking in quality or design, where I just tighten some screws and it works like any other laptop from any other company, but it\u0026rsquo;s not like the others! Almost looks like an Apple product but at the same time is so far from being an Apple product, and I think this is one of the best compliments I can give to the framework team.\nNow, the bad, or the not-so-great part. The AMD WI-FI adapter, which seems to be a rebrand of a MediaTek chip, has a really, really bad signal range. The speed is good, but the range is bad. And since I still have a bit of a gamer in me and also often have to run complex GIS operations or mess with point clouds, it handles everything really well, even AAA games with more than acceptable frames per second. But it\u0026rsquo;s noisy, noisier than I thought, although it never seems to thermal throttle or lose its footing while playing or running GIS operations. Other than that, it\u0026rsquo;s very quiet. The battery life is also not fantastic, around 4 hours, but that\u0026rsquo;s acceptable for me.\nBut the wonderful part, even about the bad or not-so-great bits, is that I can just buy a different Wi-Fi adapter and replace it, like the AX210, which seems to solve the range issue. The noisy part can probably be mitigated a little with a PTM sheet, which I\u0026rsquo;ll probably do in the future. Or I can just buy a new mainboard and use this one as a homelab / media hub. For the battery, I have to explore the configuration for TuneD. But it feels like mine, right from the get-go. It gives me more leeway as an owner because its boundaries are wider than all the other solutions on the market.\nAnd this to me is the key point in the framework experience, not just the environmental or the reparability aspect of it, which is great on its own, but it comes as tax when buying. But a tax I will gladly pay for, because it gives me a whole new range of possibilities as the owner of the product, that other brands seem to afraid to give or just don\u0026rsquo;t care, even if you pay a premium price.\nSee you soon.\n","date":"22 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/1753206000908-framework/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"The framework 13","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"1 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/denorma/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"DeNorma","type":"series"},{"content":"","date":"1 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/gis/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"GIS","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"1 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/how-to/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"How-To","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"1 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/norma/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Norma","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"1 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"","date":"1 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/series/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"1 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/sig/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"SIG","type":"tags"},{"content":" Territorial Management Instruments (IGTs) # As mentioned in the previous post, territorial management instruments (we called them IGT) in Portugal are diverse, ranging from the well-known Plano Director Municipal (PDM), which are Municipal Master Plans, widely recognized by the general public. However, at a higher level, we other like the Special and Regional Plans, while at a lower level, there are plans with smaller territorial scope, such as Detailed Plans (PP) or Rural Space Intervention Plans (PIER).\nAdditionally, there are programs and/or strategies that bind the territory and population, which must therefore be incorporated into lower-level plans, such as PDMs. For instance, the cartography associated with integrated rural fire management, which must be integrated into various municipal IGTs.\nThus, it is indeed complex to gather a range of information from different scopes, from distinct entities, each with different objectives and sensitivities towards the same territory. Furthermore, we must comply with extensive legislation, which can sometimes be quite volatile. Added to this is the evolutionary dynamics of a territory, which may change due to major forces, such as fires, or human pressure.\nPerhaps I\u0026rsquo;m oversimplifying, but the purpose of this blog series is not to philosophize about the state of IGTs, but simply to provide context and, in the end, try to implement the REN standard.\nThis may explain the current situation in Portugal, as reflected in the data from the REOT website for Municipal Master Plans.\nAs of 2022, all municipalities have published their PDMs.\nHowever, in 2022, almost half (114) continue to manage territory based on the first version of the plan, and of these, 98 have a plan in force that is over 20 years old.\nThis means that most PDMs are still in the \u0026ldquo;paper\u0026rdquo; age and thus in a raster format, making it challenging to work with territory in 2024 using raster information produced in some cases almost 30 years ago\u0026hellip;\nas much as I love pixel art, it\u0026rsquo;s a strange situation\n\u0026hellip;this makes it challenging for the public to use.\nSome examples. Previous Nextsads But the preference for raster continues to this day, and no, I\u0026rsquo;m not joking. Recently approved plans and maps binding the territory and population are still in raster format. Although they are more readable, we still lack information beyond RGB or other color models. This happens because territorial planning continues to operate as if it were still in the \u0026ldquo;paper\u0026rdquo; era, and raster maps are essentially digital copies of paper maps.\nThe Standard # Given this, standards become even more important as they allow, or at least should allow, us to move away from this outdated model focused on how the plan will look when printed. In essence, raster map production limits itself to this. We should only be concerned with the information since that is what truly binds the territory and population, not the color, line thickness, or pattern used in its representation.\n-So, how\u0026rsquo;s the application going since 2021? Yes, but before we get there, and since we\u0026rsquo;ll only focus on REN, we first need to understand what REN is and how it is developed so that we can apply the standard. But I think I\u0026rsquo;ve given a few hints on how it\u0026rsquo;s going!\nThe REN # Let\u0026rsquo;s use the official definition.\nThe Reserva Ecológica Nacional (REN), which is the National Ecological Reserve is a biophysical structure comprising areas that, due to their sensitivity, ecological function and value, or exposure and susceptibility to natural risks, are subject to special protection.\nREN areas are subject to a public utility restriction regime that establishes a set of constraints on land occupation, use, and transformation, identifying compatible uses and actions for the regime\u0026rsquo;s objectives across various area types.\n— National Territorial Commission (CNT)1\nIn other words, it consists of a set of types of areas representing the elements described above. The REN is an essential a component of the Municipal Master Plans (PDM). And despite the term \u0026ldquo;National\u0026rdquo; in its name, REN is currently developed by municipalities, even though they do not approve it. Approval rests with two central administration entities with regional delegations.\nYes, it\u0026rsquo;s a bit strange because, in my opinion, the opposite should happen, that is, REN should be produced regionally and then applied in each municipality. This would provide greater consistency and uniformity among municipalities in the same region and between regions. Additionally, some essential information for REN production might not exist or only partially exist in a municipality, such as soil maps or geological cartography.\nyeah, we\u0026rsquo;re a bit behind!\nBut also to avoid things like this. Currently the state needs to buy information from itself to produce information demanded by the state, to be delivered to the state itself.\nBut I digress. So as mention, approval depends on regional delegations, which makes standards and guidelines even more crucial. Yet, each delegation has its interpretation not only of how to obtain the types of areas composing REN but also of how to represent them. For example, in one region, a one-hectare of cartographic generalization may be allowed to ensure less noise and more compact REN patches, but in another region, the allowance can be three hectares.\nAnd to better understand this, I’ll try to be as brief as possible. The REN methodology changed in 2012, more then 10 years ago, with Portaria n.º 419/2012, of December 20. At that time, only one region implemented these methodologies, while most others refrained, considering the 2012 approved methods required testing and clarification. Many municipalities took the opportunity to review their PDMs to avoid waiting for years to approve RENs according to the new methodology. However, clarification arrived late, which likely led to biases in REN modeling up to that point.\nFor instance, clarification on one type of area, erosion, only appeared in 2020 with this document, which, incidentally, assumes that the modeling occurs in proprietary software (but that\u0026rsquo;s another rant for another time), and also with the 2019 revision of the 2012 legislation with Portaria n.º 336/2019, of September 26.\nEven after the publication of the LS calculation support guide for erosion, one region considered the guide’s method for calculating accumulated flows as poor practice.\nAll this to say that application of the standard it\u0026rsquo;s also difficult, because of divergent interpretations or distinct regional adjustments, which we’ll explore in the next part of the series when we take a closer look at the standard.\nI said this would be tedious, but it’s important to understand that reviewing a territorial management plan, while municipal in nature, depends on the nuances and subjectivities of each approving entity.\nTaken from the website https://cnt.dgterritorio.gov.pt/ren-pagina\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","date":"1 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/1730464478931-denorma_pt2/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"The DeNorm - part 2","type":"posts"},{"content":" Is normalization good? # Yes and no, it depends\u0026hellip;\nThe normalization and harmonization of data is something I consider essential, it ensures that information can be read quickly\u0026hellip;\nAlthough sometimes, when you come across data that\u0026rsquo;s too structured, like, I don\u0026rsquo;t know, INSPIRE \u0026#x1f440;, you lose track of it, to the point where it seems complicated, just because needs to be\n\u0026hellip;we have a better perception and clarity in the application or use of the information, but also a greater guarantee that the information is correct with its replication/propagation.

The normalization of ideologies and abject ideas is one of those cases, and then whoever holds power also tends to define what is “normal” and what is not, and we\u0026rsquo;ve all had History at school, or read or seen enough fiction to know what that leads to.\nBut back to data, they also say that the “denormalization” of data can be a good thing, especially when storage space is not an issue. This is because it allows the data to be read faster and better, and therefore with better performance, and even less overhead than a relational database one, especially when comparing it to ultra-normalized data.\nBut these memes exist\u0026hellip;\nor this one.\nBut sometimes it can make sense to use unstructured data, perhaps a subject for another post later on.\nThe Norms # As I mentioned in a previous post, and I\u0026rsquo;ve also hinted in this one, part of my work is in land planning and management.

At that time there was a lot going on with my life, and by a lot, I mean that I was thinking about leaving my daily work, focus only at the company that was in a new stage with a new foreign investor that joined us.
