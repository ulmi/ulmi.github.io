The normalization of ideologies and abject ideas is one of those cases, and then whoever holds power also tends to define what is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and what is not, and we\u0026rsquo;ve all had History at school, or read or seen enough fiction to know what that leads to.\nBut back to data, they also say that the ‚Äúdenormalization‚Äù of data can be a good thing, especially when storage space is not an issue. This is because it allows the data to be read faster and better, and therefore with better performance, and even less overhead than a relational database one, especially when comparing it to ultra-normalized data.\nBut these memes exist\u0026hellip;\nor this one.\nBut sometimes it can make sense to use unstructured data, perhaps a subject for another post later on.\nThe Norms # As I mentioned in a previous post, and I\u0026rsquo;ve also hinted in this one, part of my work is in land planning and management.

Why?\nnunocoracao/blowfish Personal Website \u0026amp; Blog Theme for Hugo HTML 1466 408 Blowfish # Well it was quite a simple decision, after finding it, and it came down to some of the features, but mainly because:\nit looked good; markdown support; easily updatable; good looking; multi language; and it also looked good. So by the end of last year and throughout the start of this one, I was wondering, yeah, I\u0026rsquo;m kind of a overthinker or a late bloomer when it comes to execution cause I get tangled up in the thinking part, about creating a new personal page / blog. At that time there was a lot going on with my life, and by a lot, I mean that I was thinking about leaving my daily work, focus only at the company that was in a new stage with a new foreign investor that joined us. So it was hectic and I thought\u0026hellip;\n\u0026ldquo;I should write, it would allow me to concentrate on only one thing for a brief period of time of the day\u0026hellip;write about what was happening and also exorcise it by putting it on something!\u0026rdquo;\nSeemed like a great plan, but did none of it.\nAlternatives # At the time, I was also messing a lot with LIDAR, trying to process point clouds, for forestry metrics and was using R for it.\nSo I stumble on Quarto, and it seemed really cool, lots of hype around it, seemed simpler than blogdown. So I dwelled a bit with it using R-Studio, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t have the time to make it good looking.\nAlso looked at Hugo, Astro and some other\u0026rsquo;s. And it was when I looked at Hugo that I discovered Blowfish, created by a fellow portuguese, Nuno Cora√ß√£o. And it seemed right up my alley with the command line tools, I have a soft spot for cli tools, to ease the managing of it\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;üò≥üòØüò≤üòÆüòç OMG it as 8-bit blowfish in the command line!!!\nSo sort of quick how-to. # Requirements # node latest hugo git In case you are on fedora, like I\u0026rsquo;m, just do:\nsudo dnf install nodejs hugo git -y This is one of the cool perks of Fedora, up to date packages.\nNext\u0026hellip; # \u0026hellip;run this on your command-line\nnpx blowfish-tools Select \u0026ldquo;Setup a new website with Blowfish\u0026rdquo;, and point to the folder you want.
